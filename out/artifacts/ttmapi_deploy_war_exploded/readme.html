        <h2>1.0 Introductory Notes</h2>
        <p>1.1 Each endpoint when connecting to this API will require 3 parameters (4 in the case of upserts); "token",
            "secret", and one of 3 different IDs. The parameters can either be passed through the url as a GET request or
            in the body as a POST request. The general flow of how the API works is as follows:</p>
        <p>Step 1: Takes the 3(4 for upsert) parameters and add 1 more. The additional parameter is the keyword, either GET
            or POST. Additionally, the ID parameter is immediately formatted into the url endpoint.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Once these 4 or 5 pieces of data have been gathered, a timestamp will be generated.</p>
        <p>Step 2.5: For upserts, the JSON string has all key values stripped off and placed as the first line of the csv
            string to be generated. All values that are associated with the keys are stripped off and placed into its
            own string. For upserting multiple records, this is also taken into account and each additional record,
            instead of processing keys and values, only values are taken from additional records. Once all JSON records
            have been processed, the string encoded csv is built.</p>
        <p>Step 3: At this point, all data needed to build the signature has been received/created and is now encrypted using
            SHA-256 with the secret that the user provided as the passphrase for encryption.</p>
        <p>Step 4: The request headers are built using "Authorization : =token=:=encrypted signature=" and "SignalVine-Date : =timestamp="
            where the timestamp is the one generated in step 2. The corresponding request is then made sending the
            headers(and body if needed) as required by Signal Vine.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Once the responds body and code are returned, they are returned to the end user as html code displaying
            the result. If the result is success, the html will state success and any returned data and if it is unsuccessful,
            it will state unsuccessful, the code returned, and the data that it was given.</p>
